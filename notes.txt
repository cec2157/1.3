1.login.html->check.jsp
  type username and password, then submit.

2. check.jsp->myinfo.jsp
  check if username and password match(I've already done this, but I don't know how to jump to another .jsp if they match.
And perhaps we need session to pass the username to other .jsp files. Do you know how to implement this?).

3. myinfo.jsp->message.jsp/myphoto.jsp/homepage.jsp
  In this page, we may have "my messages", "my photos" and "cec's blog". When clicking on "my messages" or "my photos",
messages or photos of this login user will appear(that's why we should pass username from check.jsp). When clicking on 
"cec's blog", jump to homepage.jsp

4.homepage.jsp(cec's homepage)
  "my photos"(only cec's photo) and "my blog"


TODO:
1. Do you know how to pass the username using session or something?
2. For the table, we may add a "url" attribute that contains the urls of the photos. Whenever the photo page is opened,
the corresponding pictures can be loaded.
